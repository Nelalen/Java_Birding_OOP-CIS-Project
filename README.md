# Java_Birding_OOP-CIS-Project
Created throughout my diploma's 2 Java courses. Contains modified code examples from the professor as well as code written by myself and some collaborative work with other students. Contains a simple, incomplete GUI for creating and storing a bird sighting. Please use the Birding.jar file to execute. All files for the project are contained in this repository.
