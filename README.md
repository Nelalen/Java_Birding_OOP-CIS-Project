# Java_Birding_OOP-CIS-Project
Created throughout my diploma's 2 Java courses. Contains modified code examples from the professor as well as code written by myself and some collaborative work with other students. Contains a simple, incomplete GUI for creating and storing a bird sighting. Please use the Birding.jar file to execute. All files for the project are contained in this repository. 

Created in BlueJ. Contains practice outputting to HTML, formatted strings, and excel sheets, as well as the use of a singleton 'Repository', unit testing and exception handling.
